### Hi there, I'm Ashley ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸŒ± I'm a digital marketer turned software tester. Digital marketers do more UAT than you might think, from the perspective of a product owner. That was how I discovered what I wanted to do next. As part of my move out of marketing, my most recent project was a website for a celebrity cupcake bakery. I also tested the features I wrote about for GetPylon, a solar sales software company. Before that, I worked in eCommerce for a coffee distribution company as the conduit between dev & line marketing/customer service/logistics/accounts/etc. It was 50/50 help desk/marketing assistant, a very unique role where I learnt a lot.

âœ¨ Over the last few months, I've put pedal to the metal and started putting together a test automation portfolio, where I apply the test theory I've learnt, reasoning and coding in public. I have outlined my thought process in my READMEs, alongside a step-by-step-by-step for installing and running each project.

As a learner, I enjoy pushing for 100% code coverage across multiple test levels, just to see if I can. As a professional, I know that is not necessary, and adds bloat which will be really annoying to maintain, and creates long test cycles which can slow down development. So now I watch it run for my own satisfaction, and then remove it. What you want from your test automation is confidence that everything important is working right, with minimal, readable code. 

I've also had the opportunity to start developing my testing philosophy. I believe that manual and automated testing complement each other, and it's not an either-or debate. They each have their place throughout the software development life cycle. What's foundational to success is truly understanding the product (the product) and its users. And that starts with a conversation with product (the team). Coming from eCommerce, I have very much a risk-based testing framework.
