### Hi there, I'm Ashley ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on my career change! I'm a digital marketer turned software tester. Digital marketers do more UAT testing than you might think, from the perspective of a product owner. That was how I discovered what I wanted to do next. As part of my move out of marketing, my most recent project was a website for a celebrity cupcake bakery. I also tested the features I wrote about for GetPylon, a solar sales software company. Before that, I worked in eCommerce for a coffee distribution company as the conduit between dev & line marketing/customer service/logistics/accounts/etc. It was 50/50 help desk/marketing assistant, a very unique role where I learnt a lot.

âœ¨ Over the last few months, I've written exploratory tests, and designed regression test suites. I've explored the wonderful world of performance testing and CI/CD. I've checked out automated accessibility testing, and conducted exploratory manual testing for an open-source project. I've taken a look at mobile testing. And of course, traditional test cases for a test plan I created by doing a case study. I've learnt the importance of making tests deterministic, and also how to, in some frameworks. And all my work and learning is out here in public. I have outlined my thought process in my READMEs, alongside a step-by-step-by-step for installing and running each project.

During that time, I've had the opportunity to start developing my testing philosophy. I believe that manual and automated testing complement each other, and it's not an either-or debate.  They each have their place throughout the software development life cycle. What's foundational to success is truly understanding the product, and its users. As a learner, I enjoy automating the testing of every little aspect of a codebase, just to see if I can. As a professional, I know that adds bloat which will be really annoying to maintain, and creates long test cycles which can slow down development. So now I watch it run for my own satisfaction, and then remove it. What you want from your test automation is confidence that everything important is working right.

âš¡ Fun fact: The first thing I ever tested was the battery pack on a solar electric car. As a participant in the 2015 World Solar Challenge, I ran Sunswift's social media, and helped out the electrical team during the leadup to the race. In fact, that's my team shirt in the photo. I still have it!
