### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm looking for my next role. 

ðŸŒ± I'm a new Software Developer in Test, with work experience in manual testing, and portfolio in automated testing. My thought process is outlined in each README, as well as a step-by-step-by-step for installing and running each project. 

ðŸ”­ In a former life I was a digital marketer, and we do more UAT testing than you might think. That was how I discovered what I wanted to do next. As part of my move out of marketing, my most recent project was a website for a celebrity cupcake bakery. I've also worked in eCommerce for a coffee distribution company as the conduit between dev & line marketing/customer service/etc.

âš¡ Fun fact: The first thing I ever tested was the battery pack on a solar electric car. It was where I first thought abour quality and safety. As a participant in the 2015 World Solar Challenge, I ran Sunswift's social media during that race, and helped out the electrical team during the leadup to the race.
