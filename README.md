### Hi there, I'm Ashley ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸŒ± I'm a digital marketer turned software tester. Digital marketers do more UAT than you might think, from the perspective of a product owner. That was how I discovered what I wanted to do next. As part of my move out of marketing, my most recent project was a website for a celebrity cupcake bakery. I also tested the features I wrote about for GetPylon, a solar sales software company. Before that, I worked in eCommerce for a coffee distribution company as the conduit between dev & line marketing/customer service/logistics/accounts/etc. It was 50/50 help desk/marketing assistant, a very unique role where I learnt a lot.

I've also had the opportunity to start developing my testing philosophy. I believe that manual and automated testing complement each other, and it's not an either-or debate. They each have their place throughout the software development life cycle. What's foundational to success is truly understanding the product (the product) and its users. And that starts with a conversation with product (the team). 

Over the last year and a half, I have been working for Digital Purpose as a hybrid tester. In that times i've been manual testing, with some performance [JMeter] and automation projects in Java [JUnit] and Postman [JavaScript] thrown in, as well as advising on comms where needed.
