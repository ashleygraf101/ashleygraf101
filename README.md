### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I'm a software tester. In a former life I was a digital marketer, and we do more UAT testing than you might think. So that was how I discovered what I wanted to do next.

ðŸ”­ I've been moving out of marketing for a while. My most recent project was a website for a cupcake bakery. I've also worked in ecommerce for a coffee distribution company. 

âš¡ Fun fact: The first thing I ever tested was the battery pack on a solar electric car. It was where I first thought abour quality and safety. As a participant in the 2015 World Solar Challenge, I ran Sunswift's social media during that race, and helped out the electrical team during the leadup to the race.
